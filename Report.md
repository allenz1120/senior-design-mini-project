# EC463 Mini Project Report
## Benjamin Li, Allen Zou

Macro Manager is an application that will let you scan the barcodes of food items and will provide a visual representation of the macros you have consumed. Users are required to login using gmail. We developed this application using react-native for cross-platform support with a Firebase database to store scanned food items. Going into this project, neither Allen nor I have done mobile-app development in the past, so this project was a steep learning for us. Howevever, we believe that we worked well as a team and the work was split fairly.

Screenshots of the application are below.
