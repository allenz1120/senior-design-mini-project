# EC463 Mini Project Report
## Benjamin Li, Allen Zou

Macro Manager is an application that will let you scan the barcodes of food items and will provide a visual representation of the macros you have consumed. Users are required to login using gmail. We developed this application using react-native for cross-platform support with a Firebase database to store scanned food items. Going into this project, neither Allen nor I have done mobile-app development in the past, so throughout this project, we experienced a pretty steep learning curve. Additionally, the use of asynchronous calls in javascript was also an obstacle for us, since throughout our college education we've only worked with sequential code-bases. Howevever, we worked well as a team and split the work fairly, and this allowed us to implement all of the core functionality.

Screenshots of the application are below.
