# Benjamin Li, Allen Zou

Calorie counter is an application that will let you scan the barcodes of food items and will provide a visual representation of the macros you have consumed. Users are required to login using gmail.

## How to Build
In order to build the calorie counter project, all dependencies need to be installed first. Refer to the **Dependencies** section for a list.

Run ```npm install``` to install all libraries and code dependencies
Run ```expo start -c``` to build the project
	 - This should then launch a window where you can scan the expo QR code with the expo app on your phone
